# run_analysis.R
#
# This R script does the following:
# 1 Merges the training and the test data sets to create one data set called "df"
# 2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
#   each measurement. 
# 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5 From the dataset in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with 
#   the average of each variable for each activity and each subject called 
#   "meansDF".  This is saved as a csv file to the working directory as
#   "meansBySubjectActivity.csv"
